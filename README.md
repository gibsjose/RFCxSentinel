#RFCx Sentinel

This is the **Sentinel** application for RFCx, which uses the `usb-serial-for-android` [library](https://github.com/mik3y/usb-serial-for-android) from @mik3y.

RFCx Sentinel is used to collect diagnostics such as input/output current and voltage as well as temperature and humidity measurements from the ATMega328P on the external board.
